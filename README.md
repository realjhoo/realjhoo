# realjhoo.com web site
 My portfolio web site at http://realjhoo.com 
 
 This site began as my original one page portfolio. Over time, it evolved into a four pager, with each page having a completely different style. Then, as part of my front-end development program with Team Treehouse, I combined all of those pages into a completely rebuilt one pager. Basically, project-9 and realjhoo became ONE. 
 
 Once project-9 was completed, realjhoo resumed its independent development; Project-9 was frozen and all changes are deployed as Project RealJHoo.
