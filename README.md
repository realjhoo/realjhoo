Repo for RealJHoo

Repo for realjhoo.com web site, which houses freelance offerings, and portfolio
If I had it to dop over, I would probably commit the actual portfolio seperately. 
Maybe I'll fix that at some point... But for now, the portfolio is contained within this repo,
primarily because it lves in a subdirectory of this project on my hard drive.
