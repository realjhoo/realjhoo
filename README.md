# Jerry L Hoover (realjhoo)

## Toki!

Hoover is a front-end web developer, with a dash of back-end knowledge, in the greater Houston area with Two Brave Dogs, where he serves as a consultant to our busy clients turning their web site dreams into... well... websites. He enjoys turning an empty page into something beautiful and functional using tools like Javascript, CSS, React, Node, Express, Vue and, on occasion, even Angular.

Hoover has a peculiar interest in the culture and religion of the ancient Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians, the Old English language, the Elder Futhark, Esperanto, Toki Pona, calendars, measuring time in various ways and the current weather conditions outside the window of his office. He is currently either coding or reading a book... or possibly pitching a tent on the side of a mountain in the snow. 

Developer. Teacher. Creator.
